# Welcome to Johnathan Specter Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

This is my version of the web portfolio challenge from Codewell.cc, created using HTML, CSS, and deployed on Netlify. I built this page from scratch using the files provided by Codewell, full responsiveness with media queries. This project was an enriching experience that further honed my abilities in web development and design.
Take a look and make your feedback, thanks!
